# vim-xheader

simple header for programmers on vim

## install

use your favorite vim plugin manager,
with the url `https://git.x4m3.rocks/x4m3/vim-xheader`.
if you don't use a plugin manager, i recommand
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), it's very simple to use.

# run the plugin

run `:AddXHeader` in a blank file.

# configuration

optional: in your vimrc, add `let g:xheader_name = 'Your Name'` to have your name in the header.
